# bachelor_yc ( SAVE MY ALL CODE WHEN I LEARN)

ob : If the content does not exist in the names file by detecting the object using the coco.names rule, the object cannot be detected /
Conclusion: You have to find a way to create the names yourself! But I don't think it's easy to make (as a result of googling) 
If I make names, it's really my code! (yolov3 or yolov4 available- I need to change the code every time! )

ob2 : Using the object detection method using yolov4, I got two pictures of beach trash from Google and used the code, and it wasn't bad, 
but I still don't have enough interpretation of the code, so I think I should open them one by one! (using this in the library) 

And I saved the pictures that I used for the code. <I think it's the best way so far. Reason: Because there's accuracy>
